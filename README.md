# Embedded Reber Grammar Turing Machine
The objective of this project is to determine the validity of an '[Embedded Reber Grammar](http://christianherta.de/lehre/dataScience/machineLearning/neuralNetworks/reberGrammar.php "what is 'Embedded Reber Grammar'?")'-string with the help of a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine "what is a Turing machine?").
It is a project of the module 'theoretical informatics' and part of my studies at the BHT (Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Technik) in Berlin.

You can try out the resulting Turing machine [here](https://florgol.github.io/ERG-Turing-machine/ "the project").

The project language is German, meaning that descriptions and documentation are in German. You can read the documentation by clicking on 'Dokumentation' in the navbar of the project website.
