# Embedded Reber Grammar Turing Machine
The objective of this project is to determine the validity of an 'Embedded Reber Grammar'-string with the help of a Turing machine.
It is the final project of the module 'theoretical informatics' and part of my studies at the BHT (Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Technik) in Berlin.
